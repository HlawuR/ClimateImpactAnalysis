# Classification-Sprint-2307ACDS-Team-NM3

## Project Overview

Many companies are built around lessening one’s environmental impact or carbon
footprint. They offer products and services that are environmentally friendly and
sustainable, in line with their values and ideals. They would like to determine how
people perceive climate change and whether or not they believe it is a real threat.
This would add to their market research efforts in gauging how their
product/service may be received.

With this context, EDSA is challenging DATABOTICS Solutions during the Classification Sprint with the
task of creating a Machine Learning model that is able to classify whether or not a
person believes in climate change, based on their novel tweet data.
Providing an accurate and robust solution to this task gives companies access to a
broad base of consumer sentiment, spanning multiple demographic and
geographic categories - thus increasing their insights and informing future
marketing strategies. 

## Problem Statement

In order to mitigate the risk associated with climate change, our client is building toward lessening their environmental impact or carbon footprint by offering products and services that are environmentally friendly and sustainable, in line with their values and ideals. Our client will like to determine how people perceive climate change, and whether or not they believe it is a real threat. This will go along way to add to their market research efforts in gauging how their product/service may be received.

## Objective

Providing an accurate and robust solution to this task gives our client access to a broad base of consumer sentiment, spanning multiple demographic and geographic categories - thus increasing their insights and informing future marketing strategies.

DATABOTICS Solutions is task with creating a sentiment analysis model that will be able to classify whether or not a person believes in climate change, based on their novel tweet data.

In order to achieve the objectives, our company will do the following:

- Analyse the supplied data.
- Identify potential errors in the data and clean the existing data set.
- Determine if additional features can be added to enrich the data set.
- Build a model that is capable of predicting tweet.
- Evaluate the accuracy of the best machine learning model.
- Determine what features were most important in the model’s prediction decision, and
- Explain the inner working of the model to a non-technical audience.
